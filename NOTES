indexSegment:
 name
 created_date
 size_bytes
 num_rows
 min_sequence
 max_sequence


(steal http headers)
 encoding?


json schema


index file contains all information, rewritten in entirety every time
compaction done as in lucene
gc done by deleting all indices too old (with failsafe of at least one) then deleting any indexSegment not referenced by any remaining index




could directly hive interop via create table / partition by indexSegment / add partition
 select row_number() over (partition by id order by indexSegment desc) rn, * from foo where rn = 1




new PUT only, r-a-w guaranteed
writing orchestrated by sql lock + generation info, reading can be done uncoordinated




tailer process
compaction/gc process
pg_xlog backup watchdog, kill pid and drop slot


schematizer? heartbeat daemon? failover?
